# XGBENC
This repository contains python and R implementation of the algorithms proposed in "XGBENC: a scalable and explainable survival prediction model based on XGBoost".
# The version of Python, R and packages
Python version=3.9
R version=4.0.3
glmnet version=4.0-2
xgboost version=1.2.0.1
randomForestSRC version=2.9.3
# The datasets of the program
The data used in this research are collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project and that are publicly available at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov.
# The describe of the program
The program is divided into three sections saved in this repository.

Data preprocessing: preprocessed data can be used to test the models, the programs can directly process the data downloaded by TCGA.

XGBENC: survival prediction model based on XGBENC was presented to analyze the patients' survival of 15 cancer datasets patients.
