# The datasets of the program
The data used in this research are collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project and that are publicly available at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov.
# The describe of the program
The program is divided into three sections saved in this repository.

Data preprocessing: preprocessed data can be used to test the models, the programs can directly process the data downloaded by TCGA.

XGBENC: survival prediction model based on XGBENC was presented to analyze the patients' survival of 15 cancer datasets patients.
